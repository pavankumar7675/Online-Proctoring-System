## 🔍 How It Works

**Note:** For detailed flow diagrams, complete algorithms, and step-by-step execution timeline, see [flow.txt](flow.txt).

### 1. Face Detection & Verification

- Uses **MediaPipe Face Detection** to locate faces in frames
- Extracts face embeddings using **FaceNet** (128-dimensional vectors)
- Compares embeddings using Euclidean distance
- Threshold: Distance < 1.0 = Same Person

### 2. Adaptive Head Pose Estimation with Baseline Calibration

**Calibration Phase (First 3 frames):**
- Collects head angles from initial frames
- Calculates average yaw, pitch, and roll as baseline
- Establishes user's natural sitting position as "zero point"
- Handles any starting angle (e.g., pitch = 110° is treated as neutral)

**Detection Phase:**
- Uses **MediaPipe Face Mesh** (468 facial landmarks)
- Applies **PnP (Perspective-n-Point)** algorithm
- Calculates 3D head orientation angles relative to baseline:
  - **Relative Yaw** (ΔYaw): Left/Right rotation from baseline (threshold: ±15°)
  - **Relative Pitch** (ΔPitch): Up/Down rotation from baseline (threshold: ±10°)
  - **Relative Roll** (ΔRoll): Tilt rotation from baseline (threshold: ±10°)
- Deviation = |current_angle - baseline_angle| > threshold
- Eliminates false positives from users not perfectly centered

### 3. Eye Gaze Tracking

- Tracks iris landmarks (468 for left eye, 473 for right eye)
- Calculates iris position relative to eye corners
- Determines gaze direction:
  - **Looking Left**: Gaze ratio > 0.65
  - **Looking Right**: Gaze ratio < 0.35
  - **Looking Center**: Gaze ratio 0.35-0.65 (Normal)
- Flags suspicious behavior when looking away from screen

### 4. YOLO Object Detection

- Uses **YOLOv8 Nano** model for real-time detection
- Detects persons (COCO class 0)
- Detects prohibited objects:
  - **Cell Phone** (class 67)
  - **Book** (class 73)
  - **Laptop** (class 63)
- Counts multiple persons in frame
- Tracks prohibited object appearances

### 5. Frame Processing

- Processes every 10th frame for efficiency
- Maximum 50 frames analyzed (configurable via `MAX_FRAMES`)
- First 3 processed frames used for baseline calibration
- Remaining frames analyzed for violations
- Reduces computation time while maintaining accuracy
- Runs multiple AI models in parallel for comprehensive analysis

### 6. Decision Logic

**Identity Verdict:**
- Authorized if `same_person_frames > different_person_frames`
- Otherwise, Unauthorized

**Deviation Verdict:**
- Deviated if `deviation_frames >= 25%` of analyzed frames (excluding calibration)
- Otherwise, Not Deviated

**Eye Gaze Verdict:**
- Suspicious if `gaze_deviation_frames >= 30%` of analyzed frames (excluding calibration)
- Otherwise, Normal

**Person Count Verdict:**
- Multiple persons detected if `multiple_person_frames >= 20%` of analyzed frames
- Otherwise, Single person

**Object Detection Verdict:**
- Prohibited objects detected if `prohibited_object_frames >= 15%` of total frames
- Otherwise, No prohibited objects

**Overall Verdict:**
- ✓ **EXAM VALID**: No violations detected
- ⚠️ **EXAM SUSPICIOUS**: Deviations or suspicious gaze detected (review required)
- ⚠️ **EXAM INVALID**: Unauthorized person, multiple persons, or prohibited objects detected

## 📊 Output Interpretation

### Frame Output During Calibration

```
Frame 10: Authorized | Pose: Calibrating (2/3) | Gaze: Normal (Looking Center) | Persons: Single | Objects: None
```

- **Frame 10**: Frame number being analyzed
- **Pose: Calibrating (2/3)**: Collecting calibration data, 2 of 3 frames complete
- No deviation detection occurs during calibration phase

### Frame Output After Calibration

```
Frame 40: Authorized | Pose: Deviating (ΔY=+18.5°, ΔP=-3.2°, ΔR=+0.6°) | Gaze: Suspicious (Looking Right) | Persons: Multiple (2) | Objects: Found: Cell Phone(1)
```

- **Frame 40**: Frame number being analyzed
- **Authorized**: Face matches reference (distance < 1.0)
- **Pose: Deviating**: Head movement exceeds threshold from baseline
- **ΔY=+18.5°**: Yaw changed +18.5° from baseline (exceeds ±15° threshold)
- **ΔP=-3.2°**: Pitch changed -3.2° from baseline (within ±10° threshold)
- **ΔR=+0.6°**: Roll changed +0.6° from baseline (within ±10° threshold)
- **Gaze: Suspicious (Looking Right)**: Eyes not looking at center (screen)
- **Persons: Multiple (2)**: Two persons detected in frame
- **Objects: Found**: Prohibited object detected (Cell Phone with count)

### Final Verdict

**Note:** All percentage thresholds are calculated based on analyzed frames (excluding the 3 calibration frames).

| Result | Meaning | Threshold |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| AUTHORIZED PERSON | Majority frames matched reference face | > 50% frames |
| UNAUTHORIZED PERSON | Majority frames did NOT match reference | > 50% frames |
| NOT DEVIATED | Acceptable head movement from baseline | < 25% analyzed frames |
| DEVIATED | Excessive head movement from baseline detected | ≥ 25% analyzed frames |
| NORMAL EYE MOVEMENT | Eyes focused on screen | < 30% analyzed frames |
| SUSPICIOUS EYE MOVEMENT | Frequent looking away detected | ≥ 30% analyzed frames |
| SINGLE PERSON | Only one person in frame | < 20% analyzed frames |
| MULTIPLE PERSONS DETECTED | Additional people present | ≥ 20% analyzed frames |
| NO PROHIBITED OBJECTS | No unauthorized items found | < 15% analyzed frames |
| PROHIBITED OBJECTS DETECTED | Unauthorized items found | ≥ 15% analyzed frames |

### Overall Verdict Categories

| Verdict | Icon | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| EXAM VALID | ✓ | All checks passed, no violations |
| EXAM SUSPICIOUS | ⚠️ | Minor violations (head pose/gaze), requires review |
| EXAM INVALID | ⚠️ | Major violations (wrong person/multiple people/prohibited objects) |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No face detected in reference image"

**Solution:**
- Ensure reference image has clear, frontal face
- Check image path is correct
- Try different image with better lighting

### Issue: ImportError for TensorFlow/Keras

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
pip install keras-facenet
```

### Issue: ImportError for Ultralytics/YOLO

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install ultralytics
# First run will automatically download YOLOv8n.pt model
```

### Issue: Video file not opening

**Solution:**
- Check video path uses raw string: `r"C:\path\to\video.mp4"`
- Verify video file exists and is not corrupted
- Try different video format (mp4, avi, mov)

### Issue: Slow processing

**Solutions:**
- Increase frame skip: Change `frame_count % 10` to higher value (e.g., `% 15`)
- Reduce `MAX_FRAMES` to process fewer frames
- Use GPU-enabled TensorFlow/PyTorch if available
- YOLO nano model (yolov8n.pt) is already optimized for speed

### Issue: High false positives/negatives

**Solutions:**
- Adjust distance threshold (default: 1.0) for face matching
- Adjust head pose thresholds relative to baseline (Δyaw: ±15°, Δpitch: ±10°, Δroll: ±10°)
- Adjust gaze ratio thresholds (0.35-0.65 for center)
- Adjust YOLO confidence thresholds for object detection
- Ensure consistent lighting between reference and test video

### Issue: Baseline calibration seems incorrect

**Solutions:**
- Ensure user maintains neutral position during first 3 processed frames
- Check that face is clearly visible in calibration frames
- Increase `CALIBRATION_FRAMES` (default: 3) for more stable baseline
- User should look straight ahead during calibration phase
- Avoid head movement during calibration

### Issue: YOLO not detecting objects correctly

**Solutions:**
- Ensure good lighting and clear view of objects
- Check object is in YOLO's training classes (COCO dataset)
- Adjust confidence threshold in `detect_persons_and_objects()` function
- Objects must be clearly visible and not occluded

## 🎯 Customization Options

### Adjust Detection Sensitivity

```python
# Face detection confidence
min_detection_confidence=0.6  # Lower = more detections, higher false positives

# Face matching threshold
if distance < 1.0:  # Lower = stricter matching, Higher = more lenient
```

### Adjust Baseline Calibration

```python
# Number of frames to average for baseline calculation
CALIBRATION_FRAMES = 3  # Increase for more stable baseline (e.g., 5 or 7)
# Higher value = more stable but requires user to stay still longer
# Lower value = faster calibration but potentially less accurate
```

### Adjust Head Pose Thresholds (Relative to Baseline)

```python
# Deviation detection based on relative movement from baseline
relative_yaw = yaw - baseline_yaw
relative_pitch = pitch - baseline_pitch
relative_roll = roll - baseline_roll

deviating = abs(relative_yaw) > 15 or abs(relative_pitch) > 10 or abs(relative_roll) > 10
# Increase values for more lenient detection
# Decrease values for stricter detection
# Note: These are RELATIVE angles (change from baseline), not absolute
```

### Adjust Eye Gaze Thresholds

```python
# Gaze direction determination
if avg_gaze_ratio < 0.35:
    gaze_direction = "Looking Right"
elif avg_gaze_ratio > 0.65:
    gaze_direction = "Looking Left"
# Adjust 0.35 and 0.65 to change sensitivity
```

### Adjust YOLO Detection Settings

```python
# Person detection confidence
if cls == PERSON_CLASS and conf > 0.5:  # Adjust 0.5 threshold

# Object detection confidence
if cls in PROHIBITED_CLASSES and conf > 0.4:  # Adjust 0.4 threshold

# Add more prohibited objects
PROHIBITED_CLASSES = {
    67: 'Cell Phone',
    73: 'Book',
    63: 'Laptop',
    # Add more COCO class IDs as needed
}
```

### Adjust Final Verdict Thresholds

```python
# Note: analyzed_frames = processed_frames - CALIBRATION_FRAMES
# Deviation threshold (default: 25% of analyzed frames)
if deviation_frames >= (0.25 * analyzed_frames):  # Change 0.25

# Gaze deviation threshold (default: 30% of analyzed frames)
if gaze_deviation_frames >= (0.30 * analyzed_frames):  # Change 0.30

# Multiple persons threshold (default: 20% of analyzed frames)
if multiple_person_frames >= (0.20 * analyzed_frames):  # Change 0.20

# Prohibited objects threshold (default: 15% of analyzed frames)
if prohibited_object_frames >= (0.15 * analyzed_frames):  # Change 0.15
```

### Process More/Fewer Frames

```python
# Frame skipping
if frame_count % 10 != 0:  # Change 10 to process more/fewer frames

# Total frames to process (includes calibration frames)
MAX_FRAMES = 50  # Increase for longer analysis
# Note: First CALIBRATION_FRAMES are used for baseline, remaining for analysis
```

## 💡 Important Notes

### Why Baseline Calibration?

The baseline calibration system provides several crucial advantages:

1. **Adaptability**: Works with any sitting position - no need for users to be perfectly centered
2. **Accuracy**: Eliminates false positives from natural variations in posture
3. **Real-world Application**: Handles different desk heights, chair positions, and monitor placements
4. **Individual Differences**: Accounts for personal ergonomic preferences and physical limitations
5. **Example**: If a user naturally sits with pitch = 110°, this becomes their "zero" - only deviations of ±10° from 110° trigger alerts

### Best Practices

- **During Calibration**: User should maintain their natural, comfortable exam-taking position
- **After Calibration**: System detects movement away from this established baseline
- **First 3 Frames**: Critical for accurate baseline - ensure face is clearly visible
- **Longer Videos**: Consider increasing `CALIBRATION_FRAMES` for more stable baseline
